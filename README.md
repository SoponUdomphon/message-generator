# Fortune Generator for Scientists

Welcome to the Fortune Generator for Scientists, your first Codecademy Portfolio Project! In this project, you will craft a message generator program that provides a new, randomized output every time it's run. The unique twist? Your messages will be tailored to inspire and amuse scientists using a structured sentence template.

## Project Objectives
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

## Sentence Structure

The messages generated follow the structure:
> In the spirit of (**Scientist**), let's (**Verb**) (**Adverb**) with a (**Adjective**) approach. Embrace the (**Noun**) and work towards unlocking the (**Object**)!

## Arrays for Components

The project utilizes arrays for various components:

- Scientists: Einstein, Newton, Curie, Hawking, Tesla, Galileo, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Turing
- Nouns: Equation, Experiment, Scientist, Variable, Quantum Realm, Algorithm, Solution
- Adverbs: Unpredictably, Diligently, Creatively, Methodically, Innovatively, Curiously
- Verbs: Solve, Embrace, Channel, Adapt, Perceive, Accelerate, Unlock
- Adjectives: Successful, Productive, Extraordinary, Mysterious, Constant, Innovative
- Objects: Challenge, Day, Experiment, Solution, Equation, Orbit, Goal

## Genchanting Artifacts

The generator also includes artifacts associated with each scientist, adding a fun and imaginative touch to the messages.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the JavaScript file to generate a new fortune message.

```bash
node script.js
